Hi. Is AI-arena solidity-based or rust-based?


[02/09/2024 05:51] mctoady
listing on #‚úãrsvp doesn't mention Rust so presumably Solidity

{Reactions}
thankyou (4) üëç 

[02/09/2024 17:23] sihing_guppy
It's Solidity-based


[02/09/2024 17:25] haxatron1
Contracts are gamefi?


[02/09/2024 17:25] haxatron1
It will be really interesting if so


[02/09/2024 17:42] sihing_guppy
yes some of our contracts have elements of gamefi in the sense that we have a game server that pushes game results on-chain, which affect how our tokens get distributed

The setup functions in your tests should set up the contracts as they are intended to be deployed? Anything we should be aware of regarding the setup?


[02/09/2024 21:05] 0xsonny
In the setup function we instantiate contracts and execute any setup functions needed for individual tests on the contract instances

how are players initially supposed to get NRN if you need to stake some in order to earn some


[02/09/2024 21:49] 0xsonny
Players can earn NRN by claiming NRN boxes or buying the token on exchanges when it comes out

{Reactions}
thankyou (4) 

[02/09/2024 22:01] sihing_guppy
Just to add, we are airdropping 8% of NRN to the community


[02/09/2024 22:01] sihing_guppy
NRN boxes, as Sonny mentioned, make up half of that


[02/09/2024 22:01] sihing_guppy
And the other half is actually through a play to airdrop campaign that we launched this week


[02/09/2024 23:30] 0xtobiking
I think the top point is cut off after "For example, let's say there are two player". This is at the end of the "Additional Context" section of the competition page.

You're correct - my apologies! We will fix that ASAP

{Reactions}

[02/09/2024 23:46] sihing_guppy
This is what it should say:

For example, let's say there are two players: A and B. Player A earned 500 points and player B earned 1500 points. If we were to distribute 1000 NRN for that round, then player A would receive 250 NRN and player B would receive 750 NRN.

Actually, I don't know if we can make PRs, so I will redirect people to this comment if it comes up again


[02/10/2024 00:08] guy_in0xnito
Which is the entry point for users ?


[02/10/2024 00:25] liveactionllamac4
I've went ahead and fixed this in the audit repo, since it was just fixing a missing example. üôÇ (note: the update may take a bit of time to push out to the website)


[02/10/2024 00:28] sihing_guppy
Entry point for a player in the game?


[02/10/2024 00:29] guy_in0xnito
In the smart contract?


[02/10/2024 00:36] sihing_guppy
But for a player, right?


[02/10/2024 00:36] guy_in0xnito
Ya ya


[02/10/2024 00:37] sihing_guppy
I would say it will generally be through the `redeemMintPass` function in the `FighterFarm.sol` smart contract


[02/10/2024 00:37] sihing_guppy
When we launch, this will be the only mechanism to get a fighter and actually play the game


[02/10/2024 00:38] sihing_guppy
over time, we will make use of `claimFighters` and `mintFromMergingPool` (but this is after the game has launched and competition has started)


[02/10/2024 00:39] sihing_guppy
Once they have a fighter in their wallet, there are many different actions they can take such as:

1) Stock up on batteries
2) Update their model
3) Stake NRN
etc


[02/10/2024 00:39] sihing_guppy
well technically they can stock up on batteries regardless (since we haven't token-gated it)


[02/10/2024 00:43] guy_in0xnito

[02/10/2024 02:53] woolcentaur
When a user calls `claimFighters` how will they know what signature to pass in?  In the test file it shows this 
```
bytes memory claimSignature = abi.encodePacked(
            hex"407c44926b6805cf9755a88022102a9cb21cde80a210bc3ad1db2880f6ea16fa4e1363e7817d5d87e4e64ba29d59aedfb64524620e2180f41ff82ca9edf942d01c"
        );
```
Where exactly does that long string come from?


[02/10/2024 03:03] sihing_guppy
Our server will give them the signature


[02/10/2024 03:03] sihing_guppy
They have to go through our application to claim


[02/10/2024 03:04] woolcentaur
Gotcha, thank you


[02/10/2024 03:19] guy_in0xnito
If fighter ops is in scope 
Does that change the sloc ?


[02/10/2024 03:25] sihing_guppy
Yea I guess it would. I‚Äôm honestly indifferent as to whether its included in the scope or not (I‚Äôm not concerned about it). If code4rena would allow us to update the readme, then we can put it in scope and update the sloc, but if not then it‚Äôs fine

Why in your sites docs does it state the fighters DNA is generated using Chainlink VRF but in the code Dna is just a hash of `msg.sender, fighters.length`?

Is there something I'm missing?

@MSaptarshi

So generally a user can only play if he has NRN

Please ask C4 staff to add it now otherwise it may be left missed.


[02/10/2024 11:33] sp1cymeatball
Uh, I think src/AiArenaHelper.sol url  on the contest page leads to a wrong contract https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/AAMintPass.sol . It's kinda confusing. Which contract is in scope? Both?


[02/10/2024 11:35] 0xsl1
While the link is apparently wrong `AiArenaHelper` should be in scope, while `AAMintPass` is explicitly out of scope


[02/10/2024 11:45] guy_in0xnito
It is in scope 
See scope.txt AAA.....Pass is not in scope


[02/10/2024 11:47] 0xsl1
that‚Äôs what i said


[02/10/2024 11:50] mladenov0603
Does protocol plan to add new fighters in a feature?


[02/10/2024 12:00] 0xsl1
What is the specific reason for limiting number of fighters allowed per particular address?


[02/10/2024 12:17] anjali_t
if we allocate x% of points to merging pool then only 1-x% of points will define our share over $NRN reward pool right?? i mean allocated points won't win u any additional $NRN tokens


[02/10/2024 12:17] guy_in0xnito
Why are the address instance created in two step process ?


[02/10/2024 12:18] shaka0x
SLOC and description also correspond to AAMintPass, so should be updated


[02/10/2024 12:29] guy_in0xnito
Who are owners & admin in the protocol?


[02/10/2024 12:52] haxatron1
Any past audit?


[02/10/2024 13:10] sihing_guppy
You can still play without staking NRN, you just won‚Äôt win any points


[02/10/2024 13:10] sihing_guppy
Apologies, we will try to get this fixed


[02/10/2024 13:16] sihing_guppy
New fighters will be added via merging pool and potentially if we airdrop some in a tournament (but inflation will be low)


[02/10/2024 13:17] sihing_guppy
That is correct


[02/10/2024 13:19] sp1cymeatball
@guppy any additional info on physical attributes? What's the attribute probability? What if I call `createPhysicalAttributes` and it returns `FighterOps.FighterPhysicalAttributes(10, 35, 50, 45, 5, 1)`, what are these numbers?


[02/10/2024 13:20] sihing_guppy
Haha it would take a while to explain all the reasons here, but it is part of our economic design and aids in preventing smurfing via rotating through fighters at a large scale. Also we will only have 420 fighters at launch, so it would be quite unusual to hold more than 10

[02/10/2024 13:25] sihing_guppy
Owners will be either our operating company or AI Arena‚Äôs foundation (depending on the contract). Admins will be key people at either of these organizations that can make more day-to-day decisions. The intention is to progressively decentralize the admin roles


[02/10/2024 13:26] sihing_guppy
No - this is referring to the economic loop. To participate in the economic loop you have to stake, but you don‚Äôt have to participate in it


[02/10/2024 13:30] guy_in0xnito
So if we don't win any points 
We dont get any nrn right ?


[02/10/2024 13:35] sihing_guppy
that is correct


[02/10/2024 13:36] sihing_guppy
It's important to note that we are not "play to earn"


[02/10/2024 13:36] sihing_guppy
You can only earn if you stake behind your fighter and are good at the game (i.e. have a relatively good win/loss ratio)


[02/10/2024 13:37] sihing_guppy
Similar in spirit to Numerai


[02/10/2024 13:38] guy_in0xnito
So a user has 2 options he can just enter to play the game 
Or 
A user who had NRN ( through stake/airdrop) can come to play then advance with the other staking options and all ?


[02/10/2024 13:42] sihing_guppy
yes that is correct


[02/10/2024 13:42] sihing_guppy
also, one might not want to stake initially if they don't know how they would do


[02/10/2024 13:43] sihing_guppy
If you compare it to something like trading where you can progressively increase you position in a trade as you get more conviction


[02/10/2024 13:43] sihing_guppy
Start with paper trading -> Enter a small position -> Increase your position


[02/10/2024 13:43] sihing_guppy
In our game the flow could be:

Enter ranked without staking -> Start staking as you get conviction -> Increase your stake as you get better


[02/10/2024 13:53] guy_in0xnito
So basically a user enters just to play a game 
Gets good at the game (wins) and now starts staking ( NRN. Which he recieved from airdrop)?


[02/10/2024 13:53] sihing_guppy
yes that is one potential flow


[02/10/2024 13:53] sihing_guppy
But most of our users will stake right away


[02/10/2024 13:54] sihing_guppy
because they've been playing the game in testnet for 2 years now


[02/10/2024 13:54] sihing_guppy
so they're quite comfortable with the mechanics


[02/10/2024 13:54] sihing_guppy
However, it is still important to provide the option to play without staking in order to boost stats when you don't necessarily want there to be economic consequences

[02/10/2024 14:27] sihing_guppy
rarityRank should probably be renamed now that you mention it - it's just a pseudorandom number, which we use in combination with the probabilities to get the index of the attribute


[02/10/2024 14:28] sp1cymeatball
So let's say we have probabilities [25, 25, 13, 13, 9, 9] for head, and rarity 50 if I call `dnaToIndex` I will get 3, right? What does 3 stand for?

[02/10/2024 14:46] sihing_guppy
I believe it will be 2 because the cumulative probability at the second index is 50, and we have this check `cumProb >= rarityRank`

Not sure if others faced the same issue


[02/10/2024 14:46] sihing_guppy
The attribute index corresponds to a specific attribute in our game. We intentionally do not say what it is on-chain to keep some ambiguity. They will see it reflected in the metadata after they mint

@guppy  if we have probability array [25, 25, 13, 13, 9, 9], are indexes 4, 5 correspond to a rarer attributes than 0 and 1, or it doesn't matter?


[02/10/2024 14:57] sihing_guppy
yes the lower probabilities are more rare


[02/10/2024 14:57] sihing_guppy
the position in the probability array does not matter

Dendroids are more rare than champions

Sorry this was our fault for naming it `rarityRank` - this is simple the pseudorandom number that we use (in combination with the probability array) to determine the attributes


[02/10/2024 16:49] sihing_guppy
the probability array dictates the rarity


[02/10/2024 16:49] sihing_guppy
i.e. if you have an array of [80, 1, 9, 10], then the second element in this array is the most rare (i.e. lowest probability of being selected)

what kind of range of numbers are possible to be sitting in this arg?


[02/10/2024 18:00] sihing_guppy
it will be pretty small


[02/10/2024 18:00] sihing_guppy
the max amount of fighters someone can have in their wallet is 10


[02/10/2024 18:00] sihing_guppy
so that is the cap for numToMint


[02/10/2024 18:02] 0xtekken
so to understand it in context - this refers to how many of those 2 types one is minting? and the server determines that possible amount? and based on that allowance gives according `signature`?


[02/10/2024 18:04] sihing_guppy
that is correct

[02/10/2024 18:05] sihing_guppy
For example, if you won two of 3 fighters in a tournament we had (let's say two of champions and 1 dendroid), then we'd create a signature for you to use onchain, where you would need to put [2, 1] for numToMint

                )
            )
        );
```

so this part of the code also makes it impossible to re-use the signature since after the first claim-use, since the `nftsClaimed[msg.sender][0/1]` won't be same as before?

In `VoltageManager.sol` what does `allowedVoltageSpenders` represent? Does it mean that if an address is allowed to spend its voltage or not? And if yes at what cases an admin would change this allowance?


[02/10/2024 19:07] sihing_guppy
Yes that's correct - each address has voltage that they have to manage (you have to use voltage to initiate a ranked battle).


[02/10/2024 19:07] sihing_guppy
The admin would only add another spender if there is another game or protocol that we want to incorporate into our ecosystem


[02/10/2024 19:08] sihing_guppy
and we wanted voltage to regulate behaviour across games/protocols


[02/10/2024 19:09] brivan
So if I got this correct: for a wallet to be able to spend its voltage (and so, initiate a ranked battle) it needs to be allowed by an admin.


[02/10/2024 19:10] sihing_guppy
correct

{Reactions}

To initiate a battle, it costs 10 VOLTAGE, this is deducted from the challenger's balance during the battle update, right? Not before


[02/11/2024 15:03] sihing_guppy
Yes during because if a bug was encountered during a match we don‚Äôt want to take away their voltage (we auto detect this)

It's a derivative of their ELO (which is how we rank fighters)

highter ELO means they are a better fighter

Excuse me, I have two questions:
1. It is said in the introduction that MergingPool.sol allows users to stake their fighters to earn rewards, but I see no staking related functions. 
2. Another question is, when will the pickWinner function be called?

If you are in a point deficit you can lose part of your stake - that is what it is refering to. If I staked 1000 NRN and I don't have any points and I lost a match, the 1 of my NRNs would become at risk (i.e. 1000 * 10 bps)

@Sonny 
Even if players have stake at risk
If he wins his points are still going to merging pool right ?


[02/13/2024 04:34] sihing_guppy
It shouldn't


[02/13/2024 04:34] sihing_guppy
```
if (stakeAtRisk == 0) {
    points = stakingFactor[tokenId] * eloFactor;
}
```


[02/13/2024 04:35] sihing_guppy
we check to see if stake at risk is 0, and only then do we set points to a value > 0


[02/13/2024 04:35] sihing_guppy
`uint256 mergingPoints = (points * mergingPortion) / 100;`

Lets say we have 6 different values for `head`
`attributeProbabilities` would hold 6 values (for each possible attribute value)  and they should be ordered from most less rare to the rarest? Is this the logic behind determining rarity %?

And do you know if a user can select in hom many matches to play, or if he participates in a round there is always a fixed number of fights for each player?


[02/13/2024 13:09] aripse
According to what I understand from the doc and answers here, you initiate at least 10 battles in one day (due to voltage). Using a battery, you can double/triple/‚Ä¶ this. A round lasts for 1 week. If another player initiate the match, you have more battle which can modifiate your ELO, but points are only modified for your fighter if you have initiate the battle.

{Reactions}
‚úÖ 

[02/13/2024 13:14] nmirchev8
But you can also initiate only one battle for the whole round if you want to?

[02/13/2024 13:23] 0xsl1
you are a little wrong, points or NRN at risk are modified for both fighters depending on the outcome. It does not matter who initiated a fight, it only affects the voltage.

ü§î ‚úÖ (6) 

[02/13/2024 13:25] 0xsl1
It can be easily seen in the updateBattleRecord function, initiatorBool variable only affects the voltage of the initiator. But regardless of the fact who initiated a fight, _addResultPoints will be called for both fighters (of course if they are staking)


[02/13/2024 13:29] aripse
Search "Challenger" and "Opponent" in this doc : https://docs.aiarena.io/gaming-competition/nrn-rewards
It tells us that only challengers are at risk for points and stakeAtRisk. not opponents.

[02/13/2024 14:12] 0xtekken
why are these two being added in the `RankedBattle::updateBattleRecord`, `amountStaked[tokenId]` + `stakeAtRisk`:
```js
        uint256 stakeAtRisk = _stakeAtRiskInstance.getStakeAtRisk(tokenId);
        if (amountStaked[tokenId] + stakeAtRisk > 0) {
            _addResultPoints(battleResult, tokenId, eloFactor, mergingPortion, fighterOwner);
        }
```
aren't the staked tokens always under `amountStaked[tokenId]`?

NVM... I understand, `stakeAtRisk` seems to be a seperate contract that holds one's NRN that is at risk of losing, so it is added on top of the `amountStaked` 

Correct me if I'm wrong.


[02/13/2024 14:30] brivan

So just to get clarification from the protocol, once $NRN is staked for a fighter, they could be the target of battles and potential points lost even if they don't initiate any fights, correct?

do you mean to ask if the opponent's consent needs to be there for a fight to follow?

If I understand correctly, the points will change based on whether the fighter wins or loses, while the initiator flag is only used to decide who is responsible for paying the voltage for that battle.

Do somebody knows whether when all user stakes goes to 'stakeAtRisk', it is possible to be matched for a battle?


[02/13/2024 17:52] brivan
From my understanding, If the round is not ended, he can still recover his stakes at risk by winning battles. If a new round is created, he has no stake left (lost them on the previous round), so he needs to stake again to be eligible for rewards


[02/13/2024 17:55] nmirchev8
But if he has no points earned for that round and no stakea left, he has nothing to loose ü§î


[02/13/2024 17:56] brivan

If all stakes are at risk?
He has nothing to loose?


[02/13/2024 17:59] aripse
Nothing to lose more, but still the hope to save some of them. So each match you lose prevents you to recover your stakes.

[02/14/2024 06:41] devblixt_
it is in a slightly different way- when you stake on RankedBattle, it in turn updates fighter staking in your FighterFarm contract


[02/14/2024 06:45] poeaudits
Can someone explain what the MergingPool contract is doing? The code says:
```
/// @notice This contract allows users to potentially earn a new fighter NFT.
```
But it seems to be almost like a reward contract for a tournament. I am unsure how it integrates with the rest of the system.


[02/14/2024 06:55] shaflow_
Users can choose to deposit some of their battle winnings points into the MergingPool. I speculate that more points will represent a higher probability of winning prizes. However, the list of winners is determined off-chain. Once the list of winners is finalized, administrators will use pickWinner to transmit the data to the blockchain. Winners can then call claimRewards to mint their own NFTs.The relevant contracts associated with this process are RankBattle and FighterFarm.Just for my understanding.

Rounds are 1 week. You can play as much as your voltage amount. Voltage is filled after 1 day or you can buy battery to fill that


[02/14/2024 07:17] _emrekocak
Also in a battle, there are 2 players and one of them uses voltage, the other one not.

[02/14/2024 07:19] _emrekocak

[02/14/2024 07:36] poeaudits
Its more determined by the number of batteries one can purchase. In GameItems.t.sol the dailyAllowance is set to 10 with them being transferable, which basically means infinite as you can use another address to mint them and trade. The deployment script has the dailyAllowance set to 5 and them not transferable.

There is a YouTube video about the reward mechanism in the official contest overview at c4. Is this binding?


[02/14/2024 15:54] devblixt_
it is in the official docs


[02/14/2024 16:02] devblixt_
i think it would make it : 

1. Easier to fetch the model for each player while battling
2. Easily verifiable that the player is using a particular model

It will be provided by the game server address, yes. afaik there are no constraints set in the code for eloFactor

@emrekocak are you warden or sponsor?


[02/15/2024 10:22] brivan
This is no issue and it is an intended behavior of the system.
There's only one who initiates the battle, called the **challenger**, the matchmaking system randomly selects a group of NFTs that are within an acceptable deviation of the Challenger NFT‚Äôs Elo and the battle happens, the **Opponent** does not get charged because he gets selected for the battle by the system.
This is clearly mentioned in the docs

Sorry if the question already been asked, does Elo for a figther get modified after a match or after a round ? I mean the elo given as a parameter by the method updateBattleRecord


[02/15/2024 11:13] brivan
My understanding says that it changes after each battle.
I'm quoting from docs: 
> If a Challenger NFT has positive Points in the current Round, the penalty for losing a match, in addition to dropping in Elo rank, is a loss of Points. We note that a Challenger NFT cannot have negative Points. When a Challenger NFT reaches 0 Points, further losses will result in their stake being placed in a new mode called ‚Äúat risk‚Äù.

Divisor is the amount of traits per attribute: for example if head divisor is 4 that means theres 4 different heads a fighter could get
Probabilities is how likely each of those heads is

And also when it comes to dendorids.... They all have the same `DNA` from my understanding? which is `DNA` of `fighterType = 1` right? But they can have a different `weight` and `element`.

@Sonny can you please clarify how the string `hex"407c44926b6805cf9755a88022102a9cb21cde80a210bc3ad1db2880f6ea16fa4e1363e7817d5d87e4e64ba29d59aedfb64524620e2180f41ff82ca9edf942d01c"` is generated?

I'm talking about `FighterFarmTest::testClaimFighters()`, which I attach here for clarity:

```
/// @notice Test whether the correct sender of the signature can claim a fighter.
function testClaimFighters() public {
    uint8[2] memory numToMint = [1, 0];
    bytes memory claimSignature = abi.encodePacked(

    );
    string[] memory claimModelHashes = new string[](1);
    claimModelHashes[0] = "ipfs://bafybeiaatcgqvzvz3wrjiqmz2ivcu2c5sqxgipv5w2hzy4pdlw7hfox42m";

    string[] memory claimModelTypes = new string[](1);
    claimModelTypes[0] = "original";

    // Right sender of signature should be able to claim fighter
    _fighterFarmContract.claimFighters(numToMint, claimSignature, claimModelHashes, claimModelTypes);
    assertEq(_fighterFarmContract.balanceOf(_ownerAddress), 1);
    assertEq(_fighterFarmContract.ownerOf(0), _ownerAddress);
    assertEq(_fighterFarmContract.totalSupply(), 1);
}
```


[02/16/2024 23:08] sihing_guppy
It's a signature generated from our server


[02/16/2024 23:08] sihing_guppy

Why in pickWinner function fighter points is set to 0 for winners? fighterPoints[winners[i]] = 0;


[02/18/2024 22:25] sobieski_adam
The more points you have in MergingPool, the bigger the chance you win the NFT. When you do win the NFT, your points get reset, which makes sense - imagine  some pro player has 99% of MergingPool points and they are never reset. He will basically win the NFT 99% percent of the time. That's why the points of a winner are wiped out - when he wins, he starts from scratch, he has to sacrifice his RankedBattle points again to have a chance of winning NFT one more time.

this function used to claim other potential give away rewards (this will be more rare occurance), got this from sponsor. And for another case, if user picked up as winner, then he / she can use claimRewards() and mint NFT rewards from mergingPool. So, claimFighters() and claimRewards() have diferent functionality

Absolutely notüòÖ


[02/21/2024 07:19] tumelo_crypto
From my understanding these are handled by the AiArenaHelper contract from the createPhysicalAttributes function

Yeah, but what if I call createPhysicalAttributes and it returns FighterOps.FighterPhysicalAttributes(3, 4, 11, 5, 2, 1), what is the meaning of those numbers?


[02/21/2024 07:23] tumelo_crypto
Those are the values of the attributes since if you look at earlier in function for dendroids it returns 99 for all six attributes


[02/21/2024 07:23] tumelo_crypto
Basically how strong your fighter is for a certain attribute out of 100


[02/21/2024 07:33] 0xwallsecurity
Look at the corresponding struct in FighterOps. It does not correspond to a fighters strength

[02/21/2024 08:04] alexander_orjustalex
I thought it could be that too, however it seems that the rarity goes from smaller ( more rare ) number to bigger ( less rare ) number. In this case, however, the dendroid starts with 99 on all and it would not make sense for the dendroid to have less rare attributes

the offchain code is gona be a big weakpoint in any bug that allows malicious users to pwn and rob other users


[02/23/2024 07:57] chris0xff
combination of pwning the oracle backend and weak contracts is the kind of thing that makes a big pwnage

aint nobody dont like a big pwn

:chefskiss:


[02/23/2024 08:09] forkforkdog
I thought the goal for being on the blockchain is not to use the chain as a database but to write contracts such that malicious inputs from backend  can be mitigated by restrictions is contracts. Eg if i would be advisor to the proj id recommend pausable architecture, like if you have backend compromised you just stop anything onchain


[02/23/2024 08:12] chris0xff
in this case the oracle i am referring to is the off chain game logic as stated by the dev team. you cant make a high impact finding based on a nonexistant PoC and hypotheticals based of speculation about a completely unknown element(the off chain game logic in this case)

What's the usual submission count? Maybe ai arena was high because It appeared to be the most interesting/fun protocol to audit


[03/13/2024 13:23] 14si2o_flint
Well usually for small contests like that there are 200-400 submissions. AiArena was 2400


[03/13/2024 13:24] swizz1337
2400 HM ? Fuuuuuuuhhh


[03/13/2024 13:24] 14si2o_flint
no in total


[03/13/2024 13:24] 14si2o_flint
so 2000? i think


[03/13/2024 13:25] swizz1337
So it could be lots of QA reports then maybe


[03/13/2024 13:25] 14si2o_flint
no i mean 2000 h/m


[03/13/2024 13:25] swizz1337
Ohhh


[03/13/2024 13:25] 14si2o_flint

Whatever the result, got to say that given the high number of submissions & dupes, this judgement speed by @hickuphh3 is damn impressive. Specially given the fact that the discussion board is not submerged with appeals - which means accuracy's pretty fine üëç

Hi. What is PJQA?


[03/21/2024 07:35] _paperparachute
There is a 48 hour window after initial judging is complete for judges and backstage wardens to discuss issues further


[03/21/2024 07:42] kuprumion
To supplement the answer above, PJQA stands for Post-judging QA

how many do you need for backstage access


[03/27/2024 14:05] tumelo_crypto
You need to have values findings in 3 c4 contest and found 1 high or 3 med or get an A on a QA report


[03/27/2024 14:06] honour_d_dev
ok, what are the perks?

I had 1 H and 1 M reports submitted both with runnable PoCs and seems both were invalidated, despite the PoCs...
Definitely need to get access to backstage asap so I can explain my logic and defend my reports.

Know a lot of people will be annoyed a their payouts (or lack thereof) but it should be known that the PJQA for this contest was very thorough. If your reports were deemed invalid/downgraded etc I am pretty confident the decisions were likely correct.

IMO the superpower of getting backstage access is being able to understand WHY your issue is invalid, so you can learn for next time, rather than because it gives you the opportunity to fight with the judge on every decision.

Sadly, only 7th position.


[03/27/2024 16:09] vangrim
I saw that some vulnerabilities were deemed invalid due to offchain mechanisms that weren't readily available on their site unfortunately. For example, a few frontrunning issues got invalidated due to the players not knowing the outcome of the fight until the results were already published

Ggs Boyz, grats to the guys who got paid big. Are our findings viewable ATM or do we need to wait? Just want to make sure incase I can make an appeal or something


[03/28/2024 03:51] swizz1337
Oh as a noobie we don't have the privilege of disputing a finding do we


[03/28/2024 04:39] swizz1337
How Is that possible?


[03/28/2024 10:29] devblixt_
Basically there's an algorithm which calculates how much payout each person gets- if you find high issues but if they are duplicated by a lot of wardens, you get less. if you find a unique (solo) vulnerability, you get more

[03/28/2024 11:40] _paperparachute
The comment above yours explains how our algorithm reduces the value of highly duplicated findings. Also would appreciate if you removed the profanity and avoid using it in future.


[03/28/2024 11:44] judeabara
Ok thank you. It wasn't me. But I was just concerned. I was shocked to see such a low amount


[03/28/2024 11:44] judeabara
When is the reward going to get to may wallet?


[03/28/2024 11:49] _paperparachute
I appreciate it is frustrating when high-dupe findings become somewhat worthless, but they do still count towards your Backstage eligibility, which is worth a lot in itself. Unfortunately, if 100 people can find a bug then it suggests the bug is relatively easy to find, and therefore less valuable to the sponsor. If 1 person finds a bug with 200 participants, the value of that bug will be extremely high.

Rewards will be sent in the next few days and will be announced in #üì¢announcements.

Must have mostly been heavily duplicated findings.


[03/30/2024 15:32] 0xtekken
I found some valid mediums that even in the roughest conditions could be taken at least as informationals.

just my opinions of course, and my PoC's opinions

Guys, it's not may be explained properly, the closest I found in the doc is [How Code4rena mitigation reviews work](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/sponsors/contest-process#how-code4rena-mitigation-reviews-work).
> Most mitigation reviews are invitational competitions between 3-5 of the top-performing wardens from your audit.
Specifically for AI Arena, you had to be in the top 3 of the wardens participating. Moreover, you need to become [certified](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-contributors) to participate in any invitational audit.

üôè thankyou 

[04/09/2024 11:36] _paperparachute
Thanks kuprum. Just to confirm, certified wardens are selected from the highest performers in audits to participate in the mitigation review. Due to their high performance in the original audit, it's clear they have the broadest understanding of the codebase, and the issues found in the original audit.
